## About Me

I'm a current junior at Duke university studying Mechanical Engineering with a math minor. I love turning ideas into physical protoypes using CAD and 3D printing. I'm passionate about robotics, aerospace, and really most projects that merge hands-on design and testing with analytical problem solving.

## Projects

**Wildfire Burn Severity Predictor | Spring 2025**  
I applied machine learning techniques, using a Random Forest classifier in Python, to predict wildfire burn severity based solely on Landsat 8 imagery and SRTM elevation data. The model achieved 70% accuracy, demonstrating the potential for data-driven wildfire management strategies.

**Children’s Toy Space Maze | Spring 2024**  
For this project, I designed an engaging space-themed toy suitable for a Happy Meal toy in SolidWorks. I designed pieces for injection molding and calculated manufacturing costs to ensure the project stayed within budget constraints.

**Seeing Sounds Engineering Design Project | Fall 2023**  
I collaborated with a team to create a system that visualizes sound for children attending the Shakori Hills Music Festival. We combined multiple inputs to produce engaging feedback, presented our design to the client and at a showcase, and received positive responses from actual users.


## Work Experience

**Ford Audio-Video -- Project Engineer Intern (Summer 2025)**
At Ford Audio-Video, I supported the installation and integration of large-scale AV systems for multi-million-dollar facilities. I assisted in commissioning and troubleshooting professional AV hardware at venues including the University of Texas Football Stadium. I collaborated closely with engineers and contractors to ensure seamless deployment of complex audio-visual solutions across multiple high-profile projects.

**Neckog Industries — Mechanical Engineering Intern | Austin, TX | Summer 2024**  
During my internship at Neckog Industries, I designed and prototyped over ten components of a desktop injection molding device, including gear pumps, valves, sheet metal housings, and stepper motor assemblies using Fusion360. I ensured strict tolerances for critical parts like motor shafts and pump gears, filed a provisional patent for a three-inlet manifold-gear pump with technical drawings, and sourced materials from local manufacturers to support late-stage prototyping and testing.


## Extracurricular Activities

At Duke, I participate in several engineering and community organizations. With the **Duke Aerospace Engineering Club**, I machined precision rocket motor components and manufactured solid propellant for a successful 30,000 ft launch. Through **Project Tadpole**, I've modified more than 15 children’s toys to improve accessibility for children with disabilities. I also help organize adaptive outdoor activities through **Duke Adaptive Explorers**, including hiking, kayaking, and sports.
